# ReadWrite.com Web Articles Analysis

This project focuses on the analysis of web articles from ReadWrite.com, a website covering IT news, technologys, business, and innovation-related topics. The goal is to gain insights into the evolution of technology and its impact over the past 20 years by analyzing the articles collected from 2003 to 2023.

## Project Overview

### Data Summary
- Total Number of Web Articles Collected: 27,211
- Data Time Range: April 19, 2003 - August 19, 2023 (approximately 20 years)

### Key Findings
- __AI__: In July 2023, there was a significant increase in the number of articles, with OpenAI's ChatGPT being a prominent topic during that time.
- __Web__: In January 2012, a massive internet protest occurred in the United States against internet copyright bills such as SOPA and PIPA, leading to a peak in the number of articles.
- __Smart Cities__: In 2016, a substantial number of articles were published, highlighting Nvidia's development of various technologies and solutions, including GPU-based video recognition and autonomous vehicles, contributing to smart city innovations.

### Major Challenges
- Keyword analysis was challenged by the presence of ambiguous words that were difficult to classify as stopwords.
- Clustering the entire dataset was challenging, with the 'Web' category overwhelming the analysis, making it challenging to create even clusters.

### Future Work
- Consider using article titles as a basis for keyword extraction to potentially reveal more prominent events and topics.
- Explore the use of N-grams for keyword extraction, as this can provide more meaningful insights by analyzing continuous word combinations in articles.
